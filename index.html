      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <h3>Chapter 1</h4>

        <p>
          Welcome to the very start of your React Native journey! If you're looking for environment setup instructions,
          they've moved to their own section. Continue reading for an introduction to the documentation, Native
          Components,
          React, and more!
        </p>

        <h2>core components</h2>
        <h3>Chapter 2</h3>

        <p>React Native is an open source framework for building Android and iOS applications using React and the app
          platform‚Äôs native capabiles. With React Native, you use JavaScript to access your platform‚Äôs APIs as well as
          to
          describe the appearance and behavior of your UI using React components: bundles of reusable, nestable code.
          You
          can
          learn more about React in the next section. But first, let‚Äôs cover how components work in React Native.</p>

        <h2>react fundamentals</h2>
        <h3>Chapter 3</h3>
        <p>
          React Native runs on React, a popular open source library for building user interfaces with JavaScript. To
          make
          the
          most of React Native, it helps to understand React itself. This section can get you started or can serve as a
          refresher course.
          <br>
          We‚Äôre going to cover the core concepts behind React:
          <br>
          + components. The rest of this introduction to React uses cats in its examples: friendly, approachable
          creatures
          that need names and a cafe to work in.
          <br>
          + JSX. React and React Native use JSX, a syntax that lets you write elements inside JavaScript like so:
          <Text>Hello, I am your cat!</Text>.
          <br>
          The React docs have a comprehensive guide to JSX you can refer to learn even more. Because JSX is JavaScript,
          you
          can use variables inside it. Here you are declaring a name for the cat, name, and embedding it with curly
          braces
          inside <Text>
            <br>
            + props. Props is short for ‚Äúproperties‚Äù.
            <br>
            + state. While you can think of props as arguments you use to configure how components render, state is like
            a
            component‚Äôs personal data storage. State is useful for handling data that changes over time or that comes
            from
            user interaction. State gives your components memory!
        </p>

        <h2>handling text input</h2>
        <h3>Chapter 4</h3>
        <p>
          TextInput is a Core Component that allows the user to enter text. It has an onChangeText prop that takes a
          function
          to be called every time the text changed, and an onSubmitEditing prop that takes a function to be called when
          the
          text is submitted.
          For example, let's say that as the user types, you're translating their words into a different language. In
          this
          new
          language, every single word is written the same way: üçï. So the sentence "Hello there Bob" would be translated
          as
          "üçï üçï".
